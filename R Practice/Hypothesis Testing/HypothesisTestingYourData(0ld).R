### In class data analysis activity ###

### For these questions use your own data 
### or one of the data sets included in R
### or one of the packages we've discussed 
### (e.g. fiverthirtyeight or openintro)
### to view the available data sets use the
### data() command

library(fivethirtyeight)
library(openintro)
data()

# Find an interesting numerical variable
#   1. calculate statistical summaries
#   2. generate a box plot and histogram
#   3. describe the distribution
#   4. generate a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the data.

# Find an interesting categorical variable
#   1. generate a frequency table
#   2. generate a proportion table
#   3. pick one proportion and calculate a 90% confidence interval for that proportion

# Find a data set with a) an interesting numerical variable
# and b) a binary (two levels) categorical variable.
#   1. Is there a difference in the means for the two groups?
#       run a t test to determine this. Use the t.test() function
#      NOTE: Are your data paired?

# Find a data set with two interesting numerical variables.
#    1. Run a linear regression model (using the lm() function)
#      NOTE: don't forget about the summary() and anova() functions.
#    2. Interpret the slope in your model.
#    3. Interpret the intercept in your model.
#    4. Interpret the R^2 value in your model
#    5. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope.
